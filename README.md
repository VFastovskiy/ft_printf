# ft_printf

The versatility of the printf function in C represents a great exercise in programming for
us. This project is of moderate difficulty. It will enable you to discover variadic functions
in C in a particularly relevant context as well as learn about a great example of a basic
“dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers.
